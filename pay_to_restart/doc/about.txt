Gives players the ability to restart (re-randomize) leaders/factions by paying 5% starting gold.

* only works on turn 1 for sides [1, 2]
* if teams consists of multiple sides, all sides take the penalty

As of this version, the add-on is very simple and stupid
* all non-leader units are destroyed upon restart
* village status is not changed upon restart

Additionally, the add-on may not work at all as I'm still developing it (2019-05-07). :-)
